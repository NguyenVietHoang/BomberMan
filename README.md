# BomberMan
This project is still in developping...
The offline game bomber man develop by Unity.
There's still have bug on pick-up item.
I will add UI, 2 players mode and PVE soon.
# The main structure:
All action will be control by GlobalManager(including PlateManager and PlayerControl), and those controler won't be affect by any Unity feature(like Physics, raycasting) in order to port it to online multiplayer in the futur.
